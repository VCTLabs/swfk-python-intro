ACM CS standards

http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html

Generic outline using 4 groups of core area topics:

1) a - What is a Computer, a Bit of History
   b - Computer Usage and Terminology, How Computers Think
   d - Operating Systems & Hardware, Programming Languages

2) a - Encoding letters with numbers
   b - ASCII and Unicode with binary, hex, decimal
   c - Elementary Computer Graphics

3) a - Problem Solving, Algorithms
   b - Designing Solutions
   c - Pseudo Code, Flowcharts

4) a - Intro to Programming
   b - Algorithms & Computational Thinking
   c - Programming Robotics, Web Applications

30 minutes each, intro with some exercises

30 minutes each hands-on pygame/other


Using SWFK (previous open source version of Python for Kids) for intro
and YoungCoder's handout, with extra hands-on examples of games.

New outline of 4 sections based on SWFK:

1) a - What is a Computer, Programming Languages
   b - Editors, Shells, and Programs
   c - First Program, Twice

Demo: pygameHelloWorld that renders "Hello World"
(this section should be quick, hoping we can save time here)

2) a - Math and Order of Operations
   b - Strings and Numbers
   c - Lists and Objects
   d - a note about language keywords
   d - Instructor-led exercises:  list of lists, wizard list (time dependent)
   e - Sec. 2, Exercises 1 & 3 (lists and strings)

Demo:
a) pygameHelloShapes that renders "Hello Shapes" and draws some shapes
(maybe save a little more time here too, or add another demo)

3) a - Turtles Can Draw (basic computer graphics)
   b - Direction and Movement
   C - Sec. 3.1, Exercise 1 & 2
   D - Sec. 5.3, Exercise 1 (maybe)

Demo:  chimp demo might be optional here, depending on time for exercises

4) a - Making Decisions, Asking a Question
   b - Logic, Conditions, and Relational Operators
   c - Let's Do It Again!

Check time and either skip to end demos (do chimp if not done yet, dodger games)
or do section 5 first, then final demos (section 5 Turtle Graphics can be optional
as desired).  Can also use turtle code as lead-in demos for games.

5) a - More Turtle Graphics
   b - Color and Fills
   c - Sec. 8.4, Exercise 1 & 2

(if 5 skipped, insert some extra shape demos here)

Hands-on demos

1. pygameHelloWorld that renders "Hello World"

2. pygameHelloShapes that renders "Hello Shapes" and draws some shapes

3. dodger game, simple arcade thing where you move around without touching 
   the stuff falling

4. dodger-with-cheats game,  variant of dodger game that has "cheat" modes 
   where you can slow the falling stuff or make it fall "up"

5. The chimp game example is derived from the line-by-line tutorial that 
comes with pygame. It is based on a `popular' web banner. Note there are 
comments here, but for the full explanation, follow along in the tutorial.
